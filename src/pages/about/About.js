          WikiLeaks is a multi-national media organization and associated
          library. It was founded by its publisher Julian Assange in 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
          WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large
          datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials
          involving war, spying and corruption. It has so far published more
          than 10 million documents and associated analyses.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “WikiLeaks is a giant library of the world's most persecuted
          documents. We give asylum to these documents, we analyze them, we
          promote them and we obtain more.” - Julian Assange, Der Spiegel
          Interview
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          WikiLeaks has contractual relationships and secure communications
          paths to more than 100 major media organizations from around the
          world. This gives WikiLeaks sources negotiating power, impact and
          technical protections that would otherwise be difficult or impossible
          to achieve.

          Although no organization can hope to have a perfect record forever,
          thus far WikiLeaks has a perfect in document authentication and
          resistance to all censorship attempts.

          “This great library built from the courage and sweat of many has had a
          five-year confrontation with a powerpower without losing a single
          “book”. At the same time, these “books” have educated many, and in
          some cases, in a literal sense, let the innocent go free.” - Julian
          Assange, Der Spiegel Interview
